Event Espresso States/Provinces Packs
=========================

These simple plugins add States/Provinces to Event Espresso 4.


Install
=========================

Download the desired States/Provinces pack and install via the WordPress admin. Once the plugin is activated, it populates the Event Espresso database with the states/provinces included with that particular add-on.

Upon successful activation, the plugin can be deactivated and removed from your website.

If you end up deleting your states/provinces and need to reinstall them, just change the name of the WP option (ex. ee_australia_states_provinces_added) and reactivate the plugin.
